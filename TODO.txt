TODO:
X Implement search space specification
- Implement variable parsing based on file time
X Implement target chunk specification
- Make some actual test cases
- Remove all unused code
- The FileVisitor currently *only* supports .java files
X The output is still grossly verbose, in useless ways
X I should make partial indices only update as necessary


BUGS:
X repeated runs result of files that have been modified result in false positives (modified methods). Clean partial index files 
X Cached partial indices won't be removed
